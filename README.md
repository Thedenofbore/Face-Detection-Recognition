# Face-Detection-Recognition
This is a repo for a face detection and recognition model that will use the OpenCV and FR libraries to detect a face and recognize the patterns in the face to tell who the person is.

# The Download bot
Please use this bot at your own risk, many search engines including the likes of google have implemented anti-scraping measures or changed their website structure, making scraping data from the web next to impossible. This is because scraping puts strain on their servers and hence also might result in a ban or even a fine. 

This bot cleaerly uses the Bing Image search API to search and download the images of the people listed in the code. In this code, I have listed 200 scientists that may have a picture on the internet. 

This bot only downloads .jpg or png extenstions, you'll ned to update that if you want to include more file types.

Please use your own bing API key to implement the API. you can get it by creating your own account at Microsoft Azure and gettting a free subscription of Bing Search API.

Of course, you'll want to update the names if you want different people, DO NOT massively increase the number of names in the code, the Bing API, servers or the code will not be able to handle too many entries.

ALso, as I'm sure you already know, you'll need to update the path where the images are stored in, in order to......well actually store them where you want.

Read the library dependencies to see what the libraries you'll need are.

And that's all there's to it. Enjoy the bot.

Cheers.
